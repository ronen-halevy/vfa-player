# vfbf-streamer
A utility for frame-by-frame video processing applications

The vfbf-streamer receives a video url, opens the pointed source video file and streams it frame-by-frame. This utility can easily be integrated with video processing apps which process the video frame by frame, e.g. object detection apps.
 
 The repo contains demo files which demonstrate an example implementation of the vfbf-stramer.
